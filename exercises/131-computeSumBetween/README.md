# `131` computeSumBetween

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function called `computeSumBetween`. Given 2 integers, `computeSumBetween` returns the sum between the two given integers, beginning at `num1`, and excluding `num2`.

## 📎 Example:

```Js
let output = computeSumBetween(2, 5);
console.log(output); // --> 9
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ The sum between `1` and `4` is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

+ If `num2` is not greater than `num1`, it should return `0`.
