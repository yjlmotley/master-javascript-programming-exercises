# `088` keep

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function called `keep`. Given an array and a keeper element, `keep` returns an array containing the items that match the given keeper element.

## 📎 Example:

```js
let output = keep([1, 2, 3, 2, 1], 2)
console.log(output); // --> [2, 2]
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ You should be familiar with the method `filter()` [More info here...](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)

+ If no elements match, the function `keep` should return an empty array `[]`.
