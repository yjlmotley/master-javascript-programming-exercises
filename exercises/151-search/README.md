# `151` search

Given a sorted array, such as this:

```js
let arr = [1, 3, 16, 22, 31, 33, 34];
```

You can use binary search for the value `31`, as follows:

1. Pick the midpoint: `22`.

2. The value is higher than `22`, so now consider only the right half of the previous array: [...31, 33, 34]

3. Pick the midpoint: `33`.

4. The value is lower than `33`, so now consider only the left half of the previous array: [...31...]

5. Pick the midpoint: `31`.

6. You've hit the value.

7. Return the index of the value.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. The function `search` receives an array of numbers and a number, it should return the position of the number given using binary search.

## 📎 Example: 

```Js
let arr = [1, 3, 16, 22, 31, 33, 34];
console.log(search(arr, 31)); // --> 4
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ **Binary search** is a searching technique which works on Divide and Conquer approach. It is used to search for any element in a sorted array.  

+ If you don't find the value, you should return `null`.

+ If at any point you calculate the index of the midpoint and get a fractional number, just round it down with the `Math.floor()` method.
