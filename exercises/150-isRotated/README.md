# `150` isRotated

A rotation on a string is defined as removing the first element and concatenating it at the end. Given N and an array of N strings. Your job is to predict the minimum number of rotations on the strings so as to make all the strings equal.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. The function `isRotated` receives two strings, if the second string is a rotated version of the first one, it should return `true`, otherwise it should return false.

## 📎 Example:

```js
let output = isRotated("Hello World", "orldHello W")
console.log(output) // --> true
```
