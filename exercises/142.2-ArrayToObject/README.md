# `142.2` ArrayToObject

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function `fromListToObject` which takes in a matrix (an array of arrays), and returns an object with **each pair of elements in the array as a key-value pair**.

## 📎 Example:

```js
let output = fromListToObject([['make', 'Ford'], ['model', 'Mustang'], ['year', 1964]]);
console.log(output); // --> { make : 'Ford', model : 'Mustang', year : 1964 }
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ Do not change the input array. 

+ Assume that all elements in the array will be of type `string`.

+ Note that the input may have a different number of elements than the given sample. For instance, if the input had 6 values instead of 4, your code should flexibly accommodate that.
