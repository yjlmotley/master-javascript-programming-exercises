# `136` sumDigits

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function called `sumDigits`. Given a number, `sumDigits` returns the sum of all its digits.

## 📎 Example 1:

```js
let output = sumDigits(1148);
console.log(output); // --> 14
```

## 📎 Example 2:

```Js
let output = sumDigits(-316);
console.log(output); // --> 4
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ If the number is **negative**, the first digit should count as **negative**.

+ In order to use some of the methods that will be most helpful to you, you will most likely want to do some string to number conversion and vice versa.

+ Be sure to familiarize yourself with the `toString()` method, as well as `Number()`.
