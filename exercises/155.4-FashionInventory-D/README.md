# `155.4` FashionInventory-D

You have a fashion catalog, an inventory of items from various high-fashion designers.

Each designer has a lineup of shoes. Each shoe has a name and a price.

The task now is to find the laced shoes, but we are going to render them in a somewhat complex format. Your function should return shoe names containing "lace" in them, and indicate which word contains "lace".

## üìù Instructions:

1. Complete the `getLaceNameDataForShoes` function to return the expected result.

2. The function goes through the `currentInventory` objects focusing on its `shoes` property, checking if the `name` of the shoes contains `lace`, this also includes `laced`.

3. Then it returns a list of objects with the `nameWords` property, whose value will be a list with the words of the shoe name that includes `lace` / `laced`. This object also has a property called `targetWordIndex` in which the index of the word `lace` / `laced` is found.

## üìé Example input:

```js
let currentInventory = [
  {
    name: 'Brunello Cucinelli',
    shoes: [
      {name: 'tasselled black low-top lace-up', price: 1000},
      {name: 'tasselled green low-top lace-up', price: 1100},
      {name: 'plain beige suede moccasin', price: 950},
      {name: 'plain olive suede moccasin', price: 1050}
    ]
  },
  {
    name: 'Gucci',
    shoes: [
      {name: 'red leather laced sneakers', price: 800},
      {name: 'black leather laced sneakers', price: 900}
    ]
  }
];
```

## üìé Example output:

```js
[
  {
    nameWords: [
      "tasselled",
      "black",
      "low-top",
      "lace-up"
    ],
    targetWordIndex: 3
  },
  {
    nameWords: [
      "tasselled",
      "green",
      "low-top",
      "lace-up"
    ],
    targetWordIndex: 3
  },
  {
    nameWords: [
      "red",
      "leather",
      "laced",
      "sneakers"
    ],
    targetWordIndex: 2
  },
  {
    nameWords: [
      "black",
      "leather",
      "laced",
      "sneakers"
    ],
    targetWordIndex: 2
  }
]
```
